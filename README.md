# jellycomb-touchpad-cfg

A quick script that configures jellycomb touchpad the way I want (so tapping, dragging and stuff like that works because for some reason it doesn't with default configuration).

In general, you'd want to configure that via `xorg.conf` but that option doesn't quite work for me if I run multiple user accounts in parallel because I'm a pleb lol.
